			<p>This section will cover javascript; its functions and elements. Such as this button:  <button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click Me!</button> As with CSS, Javascript code can be Internal (meaning coded in the individual HTML page) or External (referrencing a .JS file in the website's directory). </p>
			
			<p>Javascript can be triggered multiple ways. On this page, an alert was generated as soon as the page was refreshed as compared to the button which depends on user interaction to run.</p>
			<script type="text/javascript">
			
				alert('The page has finished loading');
